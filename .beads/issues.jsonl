{"id":"agent-maestro-1w5.25","title":"PM-VAL: Agent Config Directory Copying During Init","description":"## PM Validation Report: ACD-011 — Agent Config Directory Copying During Init\n\n**Verdict: PASS**\n\n---\n\n### Acceptance Criteria Validation\n\n| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence |\n|---|-----------|--------|----------|\n| 1 | Init supports `--with-opencode` and `--with-claude` flags | PASS | `init.go:44-45` — Both flags registered as BoolVar. `selectedAgentDirs()` checks flags first (line 189-198), bypassing prompt when set. Integration tests `TestSelectedAgentDirsWithOpenCodeFlagBypassesPrompt`, `TestSelectedAgentDirsWithClaudeFlagBypassesPrompt`, `TestSelectedAgentDirsWithBothFlags` confirm. |\n| 2 | Interactive init defaults to none on empty input | PASS | `prompt.go` PromptAgentSelection returns empty slice on empty input. Test `TestInitWithEmptyInteractiveSelectionAndFetchError` confirms no `.opencode` or `.claude` created. |\n| 3 | Conflict handling: overwrite/backup/cancel single prompt | PASS | `handleAgentConflicts` in `init.go:210-250` collects all conflicting dirs, calls single `PromptConflictResolution`, supports all 3 actions. Backup uses `agents.BackupDir` with timestamped naming. |\n| 4 | Update refreshes installed dirs and offers missing ones | PASS | `refreshAgentConfigs` in `update.go:113-157` implements two-phase flow: (1) detect+refresh installed, (2) prompt+install missing. Uses `missingAgentDirs` helper. Tests confirm both flows. |\n| 5 | Doctor reports missing dirs as warnings (not errors) | PASS | `doctor.go:87-96` checks `optionalAgentDirs`, marks as `warning: true` when missing. `allOK` is not set to false for warnings (line 100-114). Test `TestDoctorMissingOptionalAgentDirsIsWarningOnly` confirms. |\n| 6 | Dirs fetched from GitHub at runtime | PASS | `contents.go` implements FetchRef → FetchTree → DownloadBlob pipeline using Git Trees API. `FetchAgentDir` orchestrates the full flow. No bundling in release assets. |\n\n### Success Criteria from Spec (Section 4)\n\n| # | Criterion | Status |\n|---|-----------|--------|\n| 1 | `maestro init` prompts about `.opencode/` and `.claude/` (default none) | PASS |\n| 2 | `maestro init --with-opencode --with-claude` copies both without prompting | PASS |\n| 3 | `maestro doctor` reports missing agent dirs as warnings | PASS |\n| 4 | Existing dirs not silently overwritten | PASS |\n| 5 | Dirs fetched from GitHub at runtime | PASS |\n\n### Quality Gates\n\n| Gate | Status |\n|------|--------|\n| `go test ./...` | PASS (all packages) |\n| `go build ./...` | PASS (clean) |\n| `go vet ./...` | PASS (clean) |\n| Coverage: `pkg/agents` | 85.2% (above 80% target) |\n| Coverage: `pkg/github` | 68.4% (below 80% target — noted) |\n| Coverage: `cmd` | 44.7% (below 80% target — typical for CLI orchestration) |\n\n### Architecture Compliance\n\n- Layer separation respected: agent logic in `pkg/agents/`, GitHub API in `pkg/github/`, CLI orchestration in `cmd/`\n- Errors wrapped with context throughout (fmt.Errorf with %w)\n- Table-driven tests used in `contents_test.go`, `detect_test.go`\n- IO interfaces used for testability (prompt.go accepts io.Reader/io.Writer)\n- Security: path traversal and symlink attack prevention in writer.go\n- Atomic writes via temp file + rename pattern\n\n### Non-Critical Observations (for future consideration)\n\n1. **doctor.go hardcodes `optionalAgentDirs`** instead of using `agents.KnownAgentDirs()` — minor DRY violation, coupling risk if new agents added\n2. **pkg/github coverage at 68.4%** — below 80% target due to `client.go` having minimal direct tests (doGet tested indirectly)\n3. **No end-to-end success test** for full init with agent fetch (all integration tests force network failure) — acceptable since unit tests cover components\n4. **`handleAgentConflicts` backup path** not tested in integration tests (only unit tests via `BackupDir`)\n\n**None of these observations are blockers.

Add File-Pattern-to-Agent Mapping Table\nInsert a new section between Step 4 (Read the Plan Template) and Step 5 (Generate the Plan), titled **\"Step 4b: File-Pattern-to-Agent Mapping\"**.\n\nThe section must contain:\n- A markdown table mapping glob-style file patterns to agent identifiers\n- A default row mapping `*` to `general`\n- Instructions explaining: \"When generating tasks, match each task's target files against this table. The first matching pattern determines the agent assignee for that task.\"\n\nExample table format:\n```\n| Pattern   | Agent   |\n|-----------|---------|\n| *.go      | general |\n| *.ts,*.tsx | general |\n| *.py      | general |\n| *         | general |\n```\n\nNote: All agents default to `general`. Users customize by editing this table (e.g., changing `*.go` to `golang-expert-payments`).\n\n### 2. Update Step 5 (Generate the Plan)\nAdd three new rules to the plan generation rules list:\n\n6. **Assign agent per task** — For each task, match its target files against the File-Pattern-to-Agent Mapping table. Set the matched agent as the task's assignee. If no pattern matches, use `general`.\n7. **Split multi-agent tasks** — If a task touches files matching different agent patterns (e.g., both `.go` and `.ts` files), split it into separate tasks — one per agent pattern. Set dependencies between split tasks if they share interfaces.\n8. **Show agent assignments** — In the plan output, every task must include an `Assignee` field showing which agent will implement it.\n\n### 3. Preserve All Existing Content\nDo NOT remove or modify any existing steps, rules, or sections.

Update Step 3 (Route by Label)\nThe routing table and label resolution rules stay the same (labels still determine whether a task goes to Step 4/5/6). But add a clarification note at the top of Step 3:\n\n\u003e **Note:** Labels determine the **handler type** (implementation, review, or PM-validation) — they do NOT determine which agent is used.

Update Step 4d (Spawn implementation agent)\nThe existing code already uses `subagent_type=\"{assignee from task}\"`. Add fallback logic BEFORE the Task() call:\n\n```\n### Agent Resolution\n1. Read the task's assignee from `bd show {task_id} --json`\n2. If assignee is empty, null, or not set → use `general`\n3. If assignee is set but doesn't match any available subagent_type → use `general` and log a warning:\n   ```\n   Warning: Agent \"{assignee}\" not found.

Log the agent routing decision:\n   ```\n   Agent: {task_id} ({title}) → {resolved_agent} [assignee: {original_assignee}]\n   ```\n```\n\n### 3. Update Rules Section\nModify Rule 3 from:\n\u003e 3. **Route by label** — Always check the task label to determine the correct handler. Never assume a task type.\n\nTo:\n\u003e 3. **Route by label for handler type** — Labels determine the handler type (implementation, review, or PM-validation). They do NOT determine the agent. Never assume a task type.\n\nAdd a new Rule 7:\n\u003e 7. **Agent from assignee** — The agent (subagent_type) is always read from the task's assignee field.

{"id":"agent-maestro-v6k.9","title":"MST-001-005: Strip frontend to single issue list page","description":"Strip the existing Tauri frontend down to a single main page that lists open bd issues. Remove all other views, their components, and their stores. Keep only what's needed for a clean issue list.\n\n## Context\nThe existing frontend has 8 views (IssueList, DagView, ApprovalQueue, AgentMonitor, PlanList, PlanReview, TaskDetail, Timeline, ComplianceView) with 52 React files. Per ADR-002, the frontend is being stripped for now — Phase 2 will rebuild it from scratch focused on the spec pipeline. For now we just need a simple issue list as a landing page.\n\n## What to KEEP\n- src/views/IssueList.tsx — The main issue listing (458 lines). Simplify if needed but keep the sortable/filterable table of bd issues with status badges and priority labels. Remove the Dispatch/Run Epic action buttons (those are orchestrator concerns now handled by commands).\n- src/stores/dashboard.ts — Keep only: issues state, fetchIssues(), activeView (hardcoded to 'issues'), boot state, workspace selection. Remove: pendingGates, pendingPermissions, approveGate, rejectGate, resolvePermission, handleEvent.\n- src/App.tsx — Simplify: remove the view switch statement, always render IssueList. Keep: boot sequence, theme, error banner, header.\n- src/components/Sidebar.tsx — Simplify to show only the Issues nav item (or remove sidebar entirely if only one page).\n- src/components/ConnectionStatus.tsx — Keep (useful for showing bd/opencode connection state).\n- src/components/ErrorBanner.tsx — Keep.\n- src/components/WorkspaceSelector.tsx — Keep (useful for multi-workspace).\n- src/main.tsx — Keep as-is.\n- src/lib/tauri.ts — Keep only the functions needed by the simplified dashboard store (getIssues, getWorkspace, etc). Remove plan/agent/gate/permission functions.\n- src/types/index.ts — Keep Issue, ViewId (simplified), DashboardState types. Remove Plan*, TaskDetail, TrackedSession, Gate, Permission types.\n\n## What to DELETE\n### Views (delete entirely)\n- src/views/DagView.tsx\n- src/views/ApprovalQueue.tsx\n- src/views/AgentMonitor.tsx\n- src/views/PlanList.tsx\n- src/views/PlanReview.tsx\n- src/views/TaskDetail.tsx\n- src/views/Timeline.tsx\n- src/views/ComplianceView.tsx\n\n### Component directories (delete entirely)\n- src/components/agents/ (5 files: SessionCard, LaunchPanel, SubAgentTree, TodoList, ConnectionIndicator)\n- src/components/approvals/ (4 files: UnifiedApprovalItem, ApprovalDialog, GateCard, PermissionCard)\n- src/components/compliance/ (2 files: ComplianceBadge, EpicScorecard)\n- src/components/dag/ (7 files: TaskNode, ReviewNode, GateNode, PmValidationNode, EpicNode, SidePanel, statusColors)\n- src/components/plan/ (13 files: TaskCard, TaskDetailPanel, TaskDiff, NewPlanDialog, CommentThread, AgentBadge, SizeBadge, ErrorRecovery, ShortcutHelp, RevisionHistory, CreationProgress, FeedbackSummary, PlanProgress)\n- src/components/timeline/ (2 files: TimelineEntry, TimelineFilter)\n- src/components/task/ (empty, just .gitkeep)\n\n### Components (delete)\n- src/components/CommandPalette.tsx — Remove (overkill for single page)\n- src/components/BootSplash.tsx — Can keep or simplify\n\n### Stores (delete entirely)\n- src/stores/agent.ts\n- src/stores/plan.ts\n- src/stores/task.ts\n- src/stores/timeline.ts\n\n### Hooks (review and clean)\n- Remove any hooks that only serve deleted views (useKeyboardShortcuts if it only has view-switching shortcuts, useTauriEvents if it only handles events for deleted features)\n\n## Implementation Steps\n1. Delete all files listed under What to DELETE\n2. Simplify App.tsx to always render IssueList (no view switching)\n3. Simplify Sidebar.tsx or remove it entirely\n4. Simplify dashboard.ts store (remove gate/permission/event handling)\n5. Simplify tauri.ts (remove unused Tauri invoke functions)\n6. Simplify types/index.ts (remove unused type definitions)\n7. Update IssueList.tsx: remove Dispatch/Run Epic buttons, keep the issue table\n8. Verify the app builds: npm run build (or equivalent)\n9.
