{"id":"agent-maestro-v6k.9","title":"MST-001-005: Strip frontend to single issue list page","description":"Strip the existing Tauri frontend down to a single main page that lists open bd issues. Remove all other views, their components, and their stores. Keep only what's needed for a clean issue list.\n\n## Context\nThe existing frontend has 8 views (IssueList, DagView, ApprovalQueue, AgentMonitor, PlanList, PlanReview, TaskDetail, Timeline, ComplianceView) with 52 React files. Per ADR-002, the frontend is being stripped for now — Phase 2 will rebuild it from scratch focused on the spec pipeline. For now we just need a simple issue list as a landing page.\n\n## What to KEEP\n- src/views/IssueList.tsx — The main issue listing (458 lines). Simplify if needed but keep the sortable/filterable table of bd issues with status badges and priority labels. Remove the Dispatch/Run Epic action buttons (those are orchestrator concerns now handled by commands).\n- src/stores/dashboard.ts — Keep only: issues state, fetchIssues(), activeView (hardcoded to 'issues'), boot state, workspace selection. Remove: pendingGates, pendingPermissions, approveGate, rejectGate, resolvePermission, handleEvent.\n- src/App.tsx — Simplify: remove the view switch statement, always render IssueList. Keep: boot sequence, theme, error banner, header.\n- src/components/Sidebar.tsx — Simplify to show only the Issues nav item (or remove sidebar entirely if only one page).\n- src/components/ConnectionStatus.tsx — Keep (useful for showing bd/opencode connection state).\n- src/components/ErrorBanner.tsx — Keep.\n- src/components/WorkspaceSelector.tsx — Keep (useful for multi-workspace).\n- src/main.tsx — Keep as-is.\n- src/lib/tauri.ts — Keep only the functions needed by the simplified dashboard store (getIssues, getWorkspace, etc). Remove plan/agent/gate/permission functions.\n- src/types/index.ts — Keep Issue, ViewId (simplified), DashboardState types. Remove Plan*, TaskDetail, TrackedSession, Gate, Permission types.\n\n## What to DELETE\n### Views (delete entirely)\n- src/views/DagView.tsx\n- src/views/ApprovalQueue.tsx\n- src/views/AgentMonitor.tsx\n- src/views/PlanList.tsx\n- src/views/PlanReview.tsx\n- src/views/TaskDetail.tsx\n- src/views/Timeline.tsx\n- src/views/ComplianceView.tsx\n\n### Component directories (delete entirely)\n- src/components/agents/ (5 files: SessionCard, LaunchPanel, SubAgentTree, TodoList, ConnectionIndicator)\n- src/components/approvals/ (4 files: UnifiedApprovalItem, ApprovalDialog, GateCard, PermissionCard)\n- src/components/compliance/ (2 files: ComplianceBadge, EpicScorecard)\n- src/components/dag/ (7 files: TaskNode, ReviewNode, GateNode, PmValidationNode, EpicNode, SidePanel, statusColors)\n- src/components/plan/ (13 files: TaskCard, TaskDetailPanel, TaskDiff, NewPlanDialog, CommentThread, AgentBadge, SizeBadge, ErrorRecovery, ShortcutHelp, RevisionHistory, CreationProgress, FeedbackSummary, PlanProgress)\n- src/components/timeline/ (2 files: TimelineEntry, TimelineFilter)\n- src/components/task/ (empty, just .gitkeep)\n\n### Components (delete)\n- src/components/CommandPalette.tsx — Remove (overkill for single page)\n- src/components/BootSplash.tsx — Can keep or simplify\n\n### Stores (delete entirely)\n- src/stores/agent.ts\n- src/stores/plan.ts\n- src/stores/task.ts\n- src/stores/timeline.ts\n\n### Hooks (review and clean)\n- Remove any hooks that only serve deleted views (useKeyboardShortcuts if it only has view-switching shortcuts, useTauriEvents if it only handles events for deleted features)\n\n## Implementation Steps\n1. Delete all files listed under What to DELETE\n2. Simplify App.tsx to always render IssueList (no view switching)\n3. Simplify Sidebar.tsx or remove it entirely\n4. Simplify dashboard.ts store (remove gate/permission/event handling)\n5. Simplify tauri.ts (remove unused Tauri invoke functions)\n6. Simplify types/index.ts (remove unused type definitions)\n7. Update IssueList.tsx: remove Dispatch/Run Epic buttons, keep the issue table\n8. Verify the app builds: npm run build (or equivalent)\n9. Verify the app runs: cargo tauri dev\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Only one page remains: the issue list\n- [ ] All deleted views are gone (DagView, ApprovalQueue, AgentMonitor, PlanList, PlanReview, TaskDetail, Timeline, ComplianceView)\n- [ ] All deleted component directories are gone (agents/, approvals/, compliance/, dag/, plan/, timeline/, task/)\n- [ ] CommandPalette is removed\n- [ ] Only dashboard store remains (simplified)\n- [ ] agent, plan, task, timeline stores are deleted\n- [ ] App builds without errors: npm run build\n- [ ] App runs without errors: cargo tauri dev\n- [ ] Issue list displays open bd issues correctly\n- [ ] No dead imports or unused dependencies remain","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"general","owner":"maintainer@specmaestro.dev","estimated_minutes":720,"created_at":"2026-02-19T09:07:14.237226-03:00","created_by":"maintainer","updated_at":"2026-02-19T09:25:42.546254-03:00","closed_at":"2026-02-19T09:25:42.546254-03:00","close_reason":"DONE | files: 27-deleted,7-modified | pattern: frontend-strip | ref: ADR-002","labels":["frontend"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"agent-maestro-v6k.9","depends_on_id":"agent-maestro-v6k","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-19T09:07:14.237891-03:00","created_by":"maintainer"}]}
